                    <h3>Anorexia Nervosa</h3>
                    <p>Anorexia nervosa is a serious eating disorder characterized by an intense fear of gaining weight, leading individuals to severely restrict their food intake, often to the point of starvation. This disorder is marked by a distorted body image, where individuals perceive themselves as overweight even when they are underweight. Anorexia nervosa can lead to severe physical and psychological consequences, including malnutrition, weakened organs, and social withdrawal. </p>

                    <h3>Bulimia Nervosa</h3>
                    <p>Bulimia nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by a cycle of binge eating followed by compensatory behaviors such as self-induced vomiting, excessive exercise, or misuse of laxatives to prevent weight gain. Individuals with bulimia often experience a loss of control during binge episodes, consuming large quantities of food in a short time. This is usually followed by feelings of guilt, shame, and a distorted perception of body weight and shape. Bulimia can lead to ....</p>

                    <h3>Binge eating Disorder</h3>
                    <p>Binge Eating Disorder (BED) is the most common eating disorder in the United States, characterized by recurrent episodes of eating large quantities of food in a short period, accompanied by feelings of loss of control during the binge. Unlike bulimia nervosa, individuals with BED do not regularly engage in compensatory behaviors such as purging, excessive exercise, or fasting. This disorder can lead to significant physical and emotional distress, often resulting in feelings of shame, guilt, and low self-esteem.</p>

                    <h3>Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID)</h3>
                    <p>Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID) is an eating disorder characterized by a significant restriction in food intake and avoidance of certain foods or food groups. Unlike anorexia nervosa, ARFID is not driven by concerns about body image or weight. Instead, individuals may have a limited diet due to a variety of reasons, including sensory sensitivities, fear of negative consequences from eating (such as choking or gastrointestinal discomfort), or a lack of interest in food altogether.</p>
